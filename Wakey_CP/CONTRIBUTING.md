## Code guidelines
We aim to keep our code and commit style compatible with MicroPython upstream.
Please review their
[code conventions](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/blob/master/CODECONVENTIONS.md) to do so.
Familiarity with their [design philosophy](https://github.com/micropython/micropython/wiki/ContributorGuidelines)
is also useful though not always applicable to CircuitPython.

Furthermore, CircuitPython has a
[design guide](https://circuitpython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docs/design_guide.html)
that covers a variety of different topics. Please read it as well.
