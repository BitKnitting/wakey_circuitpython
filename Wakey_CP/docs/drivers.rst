.. _adafruit-libndrivers:

Additional Adafruit Libraries and Drivers on GitHub
===================================================

These are libraries and drivers available in separate GitHub repos. They are
designed for use with CircuitPython and may or may not work with
`MicroPython <https://micropython.org>`_.

.. _bundle_installation:

Bundle
------

We provide a bundle of all our libraries to ease installation of drivers and
their dependencies. The bundle is primarily geared to the Adafruit Express line
of boards which feature a relatively large external flash. With Express boards,
its easy to copy them all onto the filesystem. However, if you don't have
enough space simply copy things over as they are needed.

The bundles are available `on GitHub <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases>`_.

To install them:

#. `Download <https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle/releases>`_
   and unzip the latest zip that's not a source zip.
#. Copy the ``lib`` folder to the ``CIRCUITPY`` or ``MICROPYTHON``.

Foundational
------------

These libraries provide critical functionality to many of the drivers below. It
is recommended to always have them installed onto the CircuitPython file system in
the ``lib/`` directory. Some drivers may not work without them.
