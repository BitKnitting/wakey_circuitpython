//| :mod:`touchio` --- Touch related IO
//| =================================================
//|
//| .. module:: touchio
//|   :synopsis: Hardware accelerated behavior
//|   :platform: SAMD21
//|
//| The `touchio` module contains classes to provide access to touch IO typically
//| accelerated by hardware on the onboard microcontroller.
//|
//| Libraries
//|
//| .. toctree::
//|     :maxdepth: 3
//|
//|     TouchIn
//|
//| All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
//| are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
//| call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
//| :ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info.
//|
//| For example::
//|
//|   import touchio
//|   from board import *
//|
//|   touch_pin = touchio.TouchIn(D6)
//|   print(touch_pin.value)
//|
//| This example will initialize the the device, and print the
//| :py:data:`~touchio.TouchIn.value`.
