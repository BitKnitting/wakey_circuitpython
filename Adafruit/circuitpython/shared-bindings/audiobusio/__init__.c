//| :mod:`audiobusio` --- Support for audio input and output over digital bus
//| =========================================================================
//|
//| .. module:: audiobusio
//|   :synopsis: Support for audio input and output over digital bus
//|   :platform: SAMD21
//|
//| The `audiobusio` module contains classes to provide access to audio IO
//| over digital buses. These protocols are used to communicate audio to other
//| chips in the same circuit. It doesn't include audio interconnect protocols
//| such as S/PDIF.
//|
//| Libraries
//|
//| .. toctree::
//|     :maxdepth: 3
//|
//|     I2SOut
//|     PDMIn
//|
//| All libraries change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
//| are no longer needed. To do so, either call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a
//| context manager.
