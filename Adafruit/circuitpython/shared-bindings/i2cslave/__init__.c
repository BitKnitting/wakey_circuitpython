//| :mod:`i2cslave` --- Two wire serial protocol slave
//| ==================================================
//|
//| .. module:: i2cslave
//|   :synopsis: Two wire serial protocol slave
//|   :platform: SAMD21, SAMD51
//|
//| The `i2cslave` module contains classes to support a I2C slave.
//|
//| Classes
//|
//| .. toctree::
//|     :maxdepth: 3
//|
//|     I2CSlave
//|
//| Example emulating 2 devices::
//|
//|   import board
//|   from i2cslave import I2CSlave
//|
//|   regs = [0] * 16
//|   index = 0
//|
//|   with I2CSlave(board.SCL, board.SDA, (0x40, 0x41)) as slave:
//|       while True:
//|           r = slave.request()
//|           if not r:
//|               # Maybe do some housekeeping
//|               continue
//|           with r:  # Closes the transfer if necessary by sending a NACK or feeding the master dummy bytes
//|               if r.address == 0x40:
//|                   if not r.is_read:  # Master write which is Slave read
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if not b or b[0] > 15:
//|                           break
//|                       index = b[0]
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if b:
//|                           regs[index] = b[0]
//|                   elif r.is_restart:  # Combined transfer: This is the Master read message
//|                       n = r.write(bytes([regs[index]]))
//|                   #else:
//|                       # A read transfer is not supported in this example
//|                       # If the Master tries, it will get 0xff byte(s) by the ctx manager (r.close())
//|               elif r.address == 0x41:
//|                   if not r.is_read:
//|                       b = r.read(1)
//|                       if b and b[0] == 0xde:
//|                           # do something
//|                           pass
//|
//| This example sets up an I2C slave that can be accessed from Linux like this::
//|
//|   $ i2cget -y 1 0x40 0x01
//|   0x00
//|   $ i2cset -y 1 0x40 0x01 0xaa
//|   $ i2cget -y 1 0x40 0x01
//|   0xaa
//|
//| .. warning::
//|    I2CSlave makes use of clock stretching in order to slow down the master.
//|    Make sure the I2C master supports this.
//|
//|    Raspberry Pi in particular does not support this with its I2C hw block.
//|    This can be worked around by using the ``i2c-gpio`` bit banging driver.
//|    Since the RPi firmware uses the hw i2c, it's not possible to emulate a HAT eeprom.
