//| :mod:`rotaryio` --- Support for reading rotation sensors
//| ========================================================
//|
//| .. module:: rotaryio
//|   :synopsis: Support for reading rotation sensors
//|   :platform: SAMD
//|
//| The `rotaryio` module contains classes to read different rotation encoding schemes. See
//| `Wikipedia's Rotary Encoder page <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotary_encoder>`_ for more
//| background.
//|
//| Libraries
//|
//| .. toctree::
//|     :maxdepth: 3
//|
//|     IncrementalEncoder
//|

//| .. warning:: This module is not available in some SAMD21 (aka M0) builds. See the
//|   :ref:`module-support-matrix` for more info.
//|

//| All classes change hardware state and should be deinitialized when they
//| are no longer needed if the program continues after use. To do so, either
//| call :py:meth:`!deinit` or use a context manager. See
//| :ref:`lifetime-and-contextmanagers` for more info.
