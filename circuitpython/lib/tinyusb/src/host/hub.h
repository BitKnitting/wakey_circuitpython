 *  \defgroup ClassDriver_Hub Hub (Host only)
 *  \details  Like most PC's OS, Hub support is completely hidden from Application. In fact, application cannot determine whether
 *            a device is mounted directly via roothub or via a hub's port. All Hub-related procedures are performed and managed
 *            by tinyusb stack. Unless you are trying to develop the stack itself, there are nothing else can be used by Application.
 *  \note     Due to my laziness, only 1-level of Hub is supported. In other way, the stack cannot mount a hub via another hub.

//D1...D0: Logical Power Switching Mode
//00:  Ganged power switching (all ports’power at

//01:  Individual port power switching
//1X:  Reserved. Used only on 1.0 compliant hubs
//that implement no power switching
//D2:  Identifies a Compound Device
//0: Hub is not part of a compound device.
//1: Hub is part of a compound device.
//D4...D3: Over-current Protection Mode
//00: Global Over-current Protection. The hub
//reports over-current as a summation of all
//ports’current draw, without a breakdown of
//individual port over-current status.
//01: Individual Port Over-current Protection. The
//hub reports over-current on a per-port basis.
//Each port has an over-current status.
//1X: No Over-current Protection. This option is
//allowed only for bus-powered hubs that do not
//implement over-current protection.

//00:  TT requires at most 8 FS bit times of inter

//10:  TT requires at most 24 FS bit times.

//D7: Port Indicators Supported
//0:  Port Indicators are not supported on its
//downstream facing ports and the

//1:  Port Indicators are supported on its
//downstream facing ports and the
//PORT_INDICATOR request controls the
