## LPCXpresso

LPCXpresso is an eclipse-based IDE, so you will need to create an workspace first then import project files (.cproject & .project) into it. The following step explain how to do just that. 

1. Click *File->Import*, then expand the *General* folder and select **Existing Projects into Workspace** and click Next.

2. On the next dialog, Click *Browse* and choose the **repo/demos** folder inside the repo. You should see a list of all demo applications. \[**IMPORTANT**\] Make sure the option **Copy projects into workspace** is **CLEAR**, as demo application uses *link folders* and this option may cause problem with the copy import. Then choose any of the demo application and click *Finish*.

3. Select the configure corresponding to your development board.

4. Then select the correct MCU option from project properties then you are ready to go.

*TIPS* Working with eclipse-based IDE like lpcxpresso, you should change the indexer option in *Preferences->C/C++->Indexer* to "active build" to have a better code viewer. Those lines that are opt out by #if will be gray, I found this extremely helpful.

## Keil

It is relatively simple for Keil

1. Open the desired demo project e.g *demos/host/host\_freertos/host_freertos.uvproj*
2. Select the configure corresponding to your development board and build it.

## IAR

IAR is just as easy as Keil

1. Open the desired demo project e.g *demos/host/host\_freertos/host_freertos.eww*
2. Again select the configure corresponding to your development board and build it.

## Configure demo

Application demo is written to have the code excluded if its required option is not enabled in [tusb_config.h](). Some of combination may exceed the 32KB limit of IAR/Keil so you may want to re-configure to disable some class support, decrease CFG_TUSB_DEBUG or increase the compiler optimization level.

In addition, there are some configuration you can change such as

- CFG_UART_BAUDRATE in board.h
- CFG_PRINTF_TARGET in the specific board header (e.g board_ea4357.h) to either Semihost, Uart, or SWO.
