tinyusb is an open-source (BSD-licensed) USB Host/Device/OTG stack for embedded micro-controllers, especially ARM MCUs. It is designed to be user-friendly in term of configuration and out-of-the-box running experience.

In addition to running without an RTOS, tinyusb is an OS-awared stack that can run across RTOS vendors. For the purpose of eliminating bugs as soon as possible, the stack is developed using [Test-Driven Development (TDD)](tests/readme.md) approach. More documents and API reference can be found at http://docs.tinyusb.org
