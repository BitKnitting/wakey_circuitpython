# Adafruit nRF52 Feather Single-Bank Bootloader

These files contain an implementation of a single-bank bootloader,
which doubles the amount of flash memory available to applications
at the expense of safe over the air updates.

Two versions are present, based on release **2.0.1** and **5.0.0**
of the Nordic S132 SoftDevice. The SoftDevice is included as poart
of the bootloader binary.
