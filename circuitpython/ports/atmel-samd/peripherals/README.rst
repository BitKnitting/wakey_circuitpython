A thin unifying API atop the peripherals in the MicroChip SAMD series of microcontrollers.
It supports the SAMD21 and SAMD51.

It originated in the atmel-samd port of [CircuitPython](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython)
and will be strengthened as other people use it.

Using
======
First, add the samd-peripherals repo as a submodule within your own. For example:
`git submodule add https://github.com/adafruit/samd-peripherals.git peripherals`

This will place the files from the repo in a peripherals directory. When your repo is checked out
or updated from before people will need to:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

The header files in `samd` define the common API between the two series. Logic with most code shared
lives in a corresponding .c file. Functions with mostly different implementations are in a .c file
of the same name under the series specific directory, such as `samd21`. Includes are relative to the
top of the repo so make sure to add the location of the library to your includes path with something
like:

`-Iperipherals/`

In your Makefile create a variable which stores the series such as `CHIP_FAMILY` and alter the
source files depending on it. For example (from [here](https://github.com/adafruit/circuitpython/blob/master/ports/atmel-samd/Makefile)):

```
SRC_C = \
    peripherals/samd/clocks.c \
    peripherals/samd/dma.c \
    peripherals/samd/events.c \
    peripherals/samd/external_interrupts.c \
    peripherals/samd/sercom.c \
    peripherals/samd/timers.c \
    peripherals/samd/$(CHIP_FAMILY)/adc.c \
    peripherals/$(CHIP_FAMILY)/cache.c
```
